				<p>LOS ANGELES<br><br>The four-bedroom, three-bath midcentury modern embraces its position at the very tip of a flatiron-shaped lot by using a boomerang design to maximize the available build space. By having the softly curved wall look out onto a backyard with tall privacy hedge it can be made of floor-to ceiling windows to let in as much light as possible without letting anyone see in.</p>
